#  Web3-Binomo - Stake AVAX and Predict the Market!

Welcome to **Web3-Binomo**, a thrilling blockchain-based prediction platform built around the **Quidditch (Harry Potter)** theme to bring fun and fantasy into the DeFi world. ðŸª„ðŸš€

##  About the Project

**Web3-Binomo** lets you **stake your AVAX tokens** and place a prediction based on the AVAX price. If the price hits your predicted point within the set duration, **you win**! If not, **your staked AVAX is gone**.

But there's a twist â€” to participate, you must **own our special NFT**, which acts as your golden ticket into the game. You can **purchase this NFT using AVAX** directly from the platform.

Once the prediction is over, **you can claim your funds directly to your wallet** if you've won.
